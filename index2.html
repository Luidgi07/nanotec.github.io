                            <p> 
                                Nanotechnologies applied to the treatment of lung cancer represent transformative and promising areas of modern medicine, 
                                as previously mentioned. This field, which has evolved significantly over the last few decades, reflects advances in vast 
                                disciplines, including chemistry, biology, and physics, with a direct impact on oncology. The development of technologies 
                                capable of manipulating materials on a nanometric scale has brought new solutions to complex challenges in the treatment 
                                of lung tumours, one of the most lethal and aggressive forms of cancer.
                                For a better understanding of this report, we will look at the history of nanotechnology.
                                The idea of nanotechnology was first proposed in 1959 by Richard Feynman, a physicist, during a lecture entitled ‘There's 
                                a lot of space down there’. He predicted that in the future it would be possible to control atoms and molecules to create 
                                structures and technologies.<br>
                                This visionary concept only began to be realised in the 1980s and 1990s, with the development of tools such as the scanning 
                                probe microscope, which allowed scientists to manipulate matter at extremely small levels.
                                Then, in the 1990s, nanotechnology was applied to medicine, especially in the development of drug delivery systems.
                                Then there were the first attempts to use nanotechnology in cancer treatments, with nanoparticles made from liposomes and 
                                biodegradable polymers, which were only approved in 1995.<br>
                                In the 2000s and 2010s, nanoparticles were applied for the first time in pre-clinical studies for the selective delivery 
                                of chemotherapy drugs. With this sophisticated advance in nanoparticles, they began to be used, enabling the controlled 
                                release of drugs and the combined use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.<br>
                                With regard to the future, it can be said that in recent years nanotechnologies have been applied in immunotherapy, helping 
                                to direct the immune system against cancer cells. In addition, liquid biopsy techniques make it possible to detect tumour 
                                markers in the blood, which consequently makes it possible to make earlier and, above all, less invasive diagnoses.<br>
                                The future of these small-scale technologies therefore promises increasingly significant advances, with the development of 
                                programmable nanoparticles and nano robots that will be able to deliver drugs ultra precisely, ultimately personalising treatment based on the genetic profile of the tumour. These innovations bring longer life expectancy, fewer side effects and better results for all patients.

                            <p>
                                The biomedical applications of nanotechnologies in the treatment of lung cancer have shown enormous potential to transform the 
                                clinical approach to this disease, one of the most lethal globally. The development of specific nanomaterials for the treatment 
                                of lung cancer aims to overcome the limitations of traditional therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which often lack 
                                selectivity and can cause significant side effects. <br>
                                Of the many biomedical applications that exist for this type of cancer, the one that stands out the most is targeted drug delivery.
                                This is achieved through the engineering of nanoparticles, such as liposomes, gold nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles. 
                                These are designed to carry chemotherapeutic agents in a controlled manner and release them directly into tumour cells. 
                                The nanoparticles can be functionalised with ligands that recognise the receptors expressed on the lung cancer cells in the case, 
                                minimising the exposure of healthy tissues to the drug. This increases therapeutic efficacy while reducing adverse reactions, which 
                                improves systemic chemotherapy somewhat. <br>
                                However, as mentioned above, this is only the biomedical application that stands out most in this type of cancer, as there are many
                                others such as being used for diagnostics and theranostics, for advanced therapies such as photothermal therapy, for RNA-based 
                                therapies, and for overcoming biological barriers.

                            <p>
                                The production of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for the treatment of lung cancer involves a 
                                series of complex processes, with the aim of creating particles that are safe, effective 
                                and suitable for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. AuNPs are valued in nanomedicine 
                                due to their biocompatibility, stability and ability to functionalise with a variety of 
                                molecules, which allows for great versatility in cancer therapy. In order to be effective 
                                in the treatment of lung cancer, AuNPs must be carefully synthesised and prepared to 
                                ensure that they have the necessary characteristics to target tumour tissue precisely 
                                and safely. <br>
                                The first step in the production of AuNPs is the choice of synthesis method, which can 
                                be physical, chemical or biological. Chemical methods are the most common and use reducing 
                                agents to transform gold salts (such as gold chloride) into gold nanoparticles. In this 
                                process, the addition of stabilising agents is essential to control the size and shape of 
                                the nanoparticles and prevent them from aggregating. Chemical synthesis methods have the 
                                advantage of being fast and controllable, allowing the production of AuNPs with specific 
                                sizes and shapes, such as spheres, rods or stars, each with unique properties. Physical 
                                methods, such as evaporation and condensation, are less common due to high costs and the 
                                need for specialised equipment, but can be used to produce AuNPs of high purity. <br>
                                A promising approach is biological synthesis, which uses living organisms such as bacteria, 
                                fungi and plants to reduce gold salts and produce AuNPs. This method is considered more 
                                sustainable and less toxic, as it avoids the use of potentially dangerous chemical agents. 
                                In addition, AuNPs produced by biological methods tend to be biocompatible, a desirable 
                                characteristic for applications in medicine. However, control over the size and shape of 
                                the nanoparticles in this method is more difficult to achieve, which may limit their use 
                                in some specific applications. <br>
                                After synthesis, the AuNPs are functionalised to confer specific properties that improve 
                                their efficiency in the treatment of lung cancer. Functionalisation consists of adding 
                                bioactive molecules, such as drugs, antibodies or peptides, to the surface of the 
                                nanoparticles. This step is crucial as it allows the AuNPs to recognise and bind specifically 
                                to cancer cells, maximising the effectiveness of the treatment and minimising damage to 
                                healthy tissues. Functionalisation with polyethylene glycol (PEG), for example, is often
                                used to increase the biocompatibility of AuNPs and prolong their circulation in the body, 
                                avoiding early recognition by the immune system.<br>
                                In addition, the production of AuNPs for cancer treatment requires rigorous testing to 
                                guarantee the stability and safety of the nanoparticles. The characterisation of AuNPs, 
                                including analysis of their size, shape, surface charge and stability, is essential to 
                                confirm that they have the desired properties. Techniques such as electron microscopy, 
                                UV-vis spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering are often used to carry out these analyses. 
                                In vitro and in vivo tests are also needed to assess the effectiveness of AuNPs in eliminating 
                                cancer cells, their ability to penetrate tumour tissue and their toxicity to healthy cells.<br>
                                In short, the production of gold nanoparticles for the treatment of lung cancer is a process 
                                that requires precision and control over multiple stages, from synthesis to functionalisation 
                                and final characterisation. The ability to adjust the size, shape and surface of AuNPs makes 
                                it possible to adapt these particles to different therapeutic strategies, such as photothermal 
                                therapy and controlled drug release. With advances in production techniques and growing 
                                knowledge about the toxicity and biocompatibility of AuNPs, this approach represents a 
                                promising alternative for the treatment of lung cancer, with the potential to offer more 
                                effective, selective and less invasive treatments.

                            <h2 id="act">Action Mechanisms </h2>
                            <p>
                                Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have several mechanisms of action that make them promising tools in the treatment of lung cancer, offering high specificity and efficacy when interacting with tumour cells. Among the main mechanisms are photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, controlled drug release, immunotherapy and gene therapy, as well as the possibility of theranostic applications, which combine diagnosis and treatment.
                                <br>Photothermal therapy (PTT) takes advantage of AuNPs' ability to absorb light in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength and convert it into heat. This localised heating, resulting from exposure to NIR lasers, destroys tumour cells by damaging proteins and nucleic acids, leading to cell death through necrosis or apoptosis. This method is especially advantageous due to its selectivity, as it preferentially targets tumour cells and preserves surrounding healthy tissue, making it an effective approach for treating solid lung tumours.
                                <br>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the functionalisation of AuNPs with photosensitising molecules which, when activated by light, produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) capable of oxidising essential cell structures, promoting the death of tumour cells. This method is useful for tumours that are resistant to conventional treatments, since ROS act independently of the signalling pathways that may be altered in cancer.
                                <br>Another relevant mechanism is the controlled release of drugs. AuNPs, functionalised with chemotherapy drugs, act as vectors for the targeted and gradual transport of the drugs to the tumour. This selective delivery allows the controlled release of the drugs in response to the acidic pH of the tumour microenvironment, concentrating the therapeutic action on the cancer cells and reducing side effects. In this way, AuNPs make it possible to maintain an effective concentration of the drug in the tumour over time, increasing the effectiveness of the treatment.
                                <br>AuNPs also have promising applications in immunotherapy, as they are functionalized with immunomodulatory molecules that stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells. The nanoparticles can carry tumour antigens that ‘teach’ the immune system to identify and destroy malignant cells. In the case of lung cancer, this approach aims to combat the immunosuppression characteristic of the tumour environment by activating an effective anti-tumour immune response.
                                <br>Another significant advance is the use of AuNPs in genetic therapies, such as the transport of interference RNA (siRNA) or DNA, aimed at silencing oncogenic genes or activating specific tumour suppressor genes. This mechanism allows for a personalised approach, with precise modification of gene expression in cancer cells, promoting cell death or inhibiting tumour progression in a targeted manner.
                                <br>In addition, AuNPs offer the possibility of theranostic application, integrating diagnosis and therapy in a single system. Functionalised with fluorescent or radioactive molecules, AuNPs can be used for real-time monitoring of the tumour, making it easier to follow the response to treatment and providing more precise therapeutic planning. Because they accumulate preferentially in the tumour, AuNPs provide information on the location and size of the tumour, allowing treatment to be adjusted as necessary.
                                <br>In summary, the mechanisms of action of AuNPs for the treatment of lung cancer encompass highly selective therapeutic and diagnostic methods, with the potential to improve treatment efficacy and reduce adverse effects. These approaches represent an important step forward in the development of safer and more personalised therapies, with promising prospects for the fight against lung cancer.

                            <p>
                                The functionalisation and bioconjugation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) has been prominent in the development of advanced therapies for the treatment of lung cancer, exploiting the unique properties of these particles, such as high stability, biocompatibility and energy conversion capacity. These modifications make AuNPs promising for the selective delivery of drugs and other therapies into the tumour environment, as well as offering less invasive and more effective therapeutic options.
                                 <br>The functionalisation process involves modifying the surface of nanoparticles to allow controlled interaction with cancer cells, ensuring specific and efficient delivery. Functionalisation strategies include the binding of specific molecules, such as antibodies and peptides, which recognise and bind to biomarkers expressed on lung cancer cells. This results in high selectivity, targeting treatment directly at tumour cells and reducing side effects on healthy tissues. 
                                 <br>Another approach is to modify the surface of the AuNPs with chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin or paclitaxel, which are released directly into the cancer cells, increasing therapeutic efficacy and decreasing overall toxicity. 
                                 <br>In addition, coating the nanoparticles with biocompatible polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), can increase the stability of the nanoparticles in the body and improve their blood circulation, prolonging their time of action.
                                 <br>Bioconjugation, meanwhile, is the process of binding biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids or antibodies to the surface of AuNPs, facilitating their interaction with specific biological targets in the body. In the case of lung cancer, antibody bioconjugation allows the nanoparticles to identify and bind to specific membrane proteins of the cancer cells, facilitating the precise delivery of the therapy to the tumour. Similarly, bioconjugation with DNA or RNA opens up possibilities for genetic therapies that target specific mutations or gene silencing in cancer cells. Bioactive peptides are also frequently conjugated with AuNPs, enhancing the therapeutic effect, since some of these peptides have intrinsic anti-tumour properties.
                                 <br>These functionalized and bioconjugated nanoparticles have been used in innovative approaches for the treatment of lung cancer. Photothermal therapy (PTT) is one such strategy, in which AuNPs, when exposed to infrared laser light, convert this energy into heat and induce the destruction of tumour cells through hyperthermia. 
                                 <br>In short, the functionalisation and bioconjugation of gold nanoparticles represent significant advances in the search for more specific and effective treatments against lung cancer, making it possible to develop therapeutic approaches that combine innovation with less impact on the patient's general health.

                            <p>
                                Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) offer significant potential for the treatment of lung cancer, but their toxicity is a crucial aspect that needs to be carefully managed to ensure the safety and efficacy of the treatment. The toxicity of AuNPs depends on several factors, including size, shape, dose, surface functionalisation and exposure time. The size and shape of AuNPs influence their biodistribution and toxicity: smaller particles, with a diameter of less than 10 nm, tend to accumulate in organs such as the liver, spleen and kidneys, where elimination is more difficult and can cause toxic effects. In addition, AuNPs with spherical shapes generally have lower toxicity compared to those with other shapes, such as rods or stars, which makes it essential to develop AuNPs with optimised sizes and shapes to reduce toxicity and improve therapeutic efficacy.
                                <br>Another important factor is the functionalized surface of AuNPs. These are often modified with biocompatible molecules such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), which helps to reduce toxicity by preventing particle aggregation and decreasing recognition by the immune system. In contrast, AuNPs with negative or positive surface charges can interact more aggressively with the cell membrane, increasing toxicity. Therefore, careful functionalisation is essential to control toxicity, ensuring safer and more effective distribution in the body.
                                <br>The dose of AuNPs is one of the main determinants of toxicity. Higher doses can cause oxidative damage to cells, promoting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause oxidative stress, leading to cell death in both cancerous and healthy cells. Adjusting the dose and applying it gradually or locally helps to reduce these toxic effects, increasing the safety of the treatment.
                                <br>The biodistribution and elimination of AuNPs also influence the level of toxicity. When administered, AuNPs tend to accumulate mainly in the liver and spleen, the main organs responsible for filtering and eliminating foreign particles. This retention can cause long-term damage, such as immunotoxic effects and chronic inflammation. For the treatment of lung cancer, the development of AuNPs with modifications that favour rapid elimination by the kidneys could be an effective strategy for reducing accumulated toxicity.
                                <br>Chronic toxicity is another important concern, since prolonged exposure to AuNPs can lead to subclinical effects such as alterations in liver function and the immune system, as well as a potential risk of genotoxic effects. Studies indicate that AuNPs can penetrate cells and interfere with DNA, depending on their characteristics, making long-term clinical trials essential to assess long-term safety. The development of biocompatible AuNPs, controlled release strategies and the customisation of nanoparticles based on the specific characteristics of each patient and tumour type are promising solutions for controlling toxicity and ensuring safer treatments.
                                <br>In summary, although AuNPs are promising in the treatment of lung cancer, their toxicity must be carefully managed. Optimisation of parameters such as size, shape, functionalised surface and dose, as well as in-depth studies on long-term effects, are essential to develop safer and more effective therapies. With continued advances in nanomedicine and detailed clinical trials, it will be possible to improve safety and personalise the use of AuNPs in the treatment of lung cancer.
