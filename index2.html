                            <p> 
                                Nanotechnologies applied to the treatment of lung cancer represent transformative and promising areas of modern medicine, 
                                as previously mentioned. This field, which has evolved significantly over the last few decades, reflects advances in vast 
                                disciplines, including chemistry, biology, and physics, with a direct impact on oncology. The development of technologies 
                                capable of manipulating materials on a nanometric scale has brought new solutions to complex challenges in the treatment 
                                of lung tumours, one of the most lethal and aggressive forms of cancer.
                                For a better understanding of this report, we will look at the history of nanotechnology.
                                The idea of nanotechnology was first proposed in 1959 by Richard Feynman, a physicist, during a lecture entitled ‘There's 
                                a lot of space down there’. He predicted that in the future it would be possible to control atoms and molecules to create 
                                structures and technologies.<br>
                                This visionary concept only began to be realised in the 1980s and 1990s, with the development of tools such as the scanning 
                                probe microscope, which allowed scientists to manipulate matter at extremely small levels.
                                Then, in the 1990s, nanotechnology was applied to medicine, especially in the development of drug delivery systems.
                                Then there were the first attempts to use nanotechnology in cancer treatments, with nanoparticles made from liposomes and 
                                biodegradable polymers, which were only approved in 1995.<br>
                                In the 2000s and 2010s, nanoparticles were applied for the first time in pre-clinical studies for the selective delivery 
                                of chemotherapy drugs. With this sophisticated advance in nanoparticles, they began to be used, enabling the controlled 
                                release of drugs and the combined use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.<br>
                                With regard to the future, it can be said that in recent years nanotechnologies have been applied in immunotherapy, helping 
                                to direct the immune system against cancer cells. In addition, liquid biopsy techniques make it possible to detect tumour 
                                markers in the blood, which consequently makes it possible to make earlier and, above all, less invasive diagnoses.<br>
                                The future of these small-scale technologies therefore promises increasingly significant advances, with the development of 
                                programmable nanoparticles and nano robots that will be able to deliver drugs ultra precisely, ultimately personalising treatment based on the genetic profile of the tumour. These innovations bring longer life expectancy, fewer side effects and better results for all patients.

                            <p>
                                The biomedical applications of nanotechnologies in the treatment of lung cancer have shown enormous potential to transform the 
                                clinical approach to this disease, one of the most lethal globally. The development of specific nanomaterials for the treatment 
                                of lung cancer aims to overcome the limitations of traditional therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which often lack 
                                selectivity and can cause significant side effects. <br>
                                Of the many biomedical applications that exist for this type of cancer, the one that stands out the most is targeted drug delivery.
                                This is achieved through the engineering of nanoparticles, such as liposomes, gold nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles. 
                                These are designed to carry chemotherapeutic agents in a controlled manner and release them directly into tumour cells. 
                                The nanoparticles can be functionalised with ligands that recognise the receptors expressed on the lung cancer cells in the case, 
                                minimising the exposure of healthy tissues to the drug. This increases therapeutic efficacy while reducing adverse reactions, which 
                                improves systemic chemotherapy somewhat. <br>
                                However, as mentioned above, this is only the biomedical application that stands out most in this type of cancer, as there are many
                                others such as being used for diagnostics and theranostics, for advanced therapies such as photothermal therapy, for RNA-based 
                                therapies, and for overcoming biological barriers.

                                No futuro, espera-se que estes desafios possam deixar de ser limitações, 
                                permitindo uma maior implementação da Telecirurgia, na população em geral.
                                 O futuro da Telecirurgia apresenta-se bastante promissor, sendo uma 
                                 ferramenta essencial para doentes que se encontram em zonas mais isoladas, 
                                 com menos acesso a bons cuidados de saúde. Mesmo à distância, os robôs podem 
                                 melhorar qualquer cirurgia.  Para os cirurgiões, realizar a cirurgia sentados 
                                 é menos cansativo do que estarem curvados e em pé durante horas. 
                                 “A inteligência artificial vai ter um impacto enorme, tal como os computadores tiveram na década de 80. 
                                 No fim não haverá nenhum trabalho humano que os robôs não sejam capazes de fazer”, disse Ben Goertzel.
